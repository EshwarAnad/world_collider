World Collider
=================

World Collider is an urban research project that uses augmented reality as a medium to collide different worlds. By fusing the different worlds of East and West, fiction and real, the urban and the suburban, and the modern and the contemporary, the project aims to offer a new perspective on the way we view cities.
